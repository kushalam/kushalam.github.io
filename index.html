<p style="text-align: justify">I have a Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Purdue University. My research interests include aircraft design and optimization, complex systems design, air transportation systems, and systems engineering.</p>

<p>In the past, I have worked on the conceptual design and sizing of a regional commercial transport aircraft as well as on the design and sizing of an unmanned aerial vehicle for high altitude surveillance. At Purdue, I worked on assessment of new aircraft technologies on aviation's environmental impact. In addition, I have worked on study of the effects on network performance as a result of the preferences and consequent decisions of the autonomous nodes.</p>

<p>My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on modeling and analysis of the complex systems design process. The objective is to model the design teams' decision-making and to use these models to identify heuristics for complex systems design.</p>
