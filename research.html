                  <hr>
                  <p>This project studies the engineering design process for complex systems and presents an approach for its modeling and analysis. Though many studies on design processes exist, there is still a need to further incorporate considerations of the social, cultural, and political aspects during process design. Proposed modeling in this work models design teams as learning agents who adapt their behavior based on changing information.</p>

                  <h4>Decision-centric Foundations for Modeling Complex Evolutionary Networks</h4>
                  <hr>
                  <p>In this project, we developed a random utility based discrete choice analysis method to model the evolution of complex endogenous networks as a result of the decision-making of its constituent autonomous nodes. The goal was to study how the decisions and interactions of these nodes affects network structure and ultimately its performance. We demonstrated the application of the framework to airlines' decision-making on route-selection problems as well as the evolution of the Internet network.</p>

                  <!--<p style="text-align: justify">Networks are a useful way of representing several complex systems. In this project, modeling of system networks is done under the assumption that the nodes are autonomous decision-making entities whose linking decisions lead to network evolution and consequently has an effect on its performance. Modeling is based on random utility discrete choice modeling and is based off of publicly available network data. Currently, this project has been applied to the modeling of both the US air transportation network as well as the Internet.</p>-->

                  <h4>Fleet-level Environmental Evaluation Tool (FLEET)</h4>
                  <hr>
                  <p>In this project, we developed a Matlab based tool for measuring system-wide environmental impact of aviation. The tool uses a mixed integer programming approach to airline fleet allocation under various technological, economic, and policy scenarios. It includes different modules for aviation market demand growth, airline decisions on aircraft acquisition, and simulation of airline competition, modeled in a system dynamics-type approach.</p>

                  <!--<p style="text-align: justify">The Fleet-Level Environmental Evaluation Tool (FLEET) is a computational simulation tool developed to assess the impact of new aircraft concepts and technologies on aviation’s contribution to environmental emissions and noise. The objective of FLEET is to compute, under a wide variety of scenarios, the impact of factors such as market condition, policy implementation, and technology availability on these environmental metrics. At the heart of FLEET is an aircraft allocation model that represents the airlines’ profit-seeking operational decisions. Around the allocation model is a system dynamics inspired approach that mimics the economics of airline operations, models their decisions regarding retirement and acquisition of aircraft, and estimates market demand growth.</p>-->
