title: Systems Engineering Toolbox For Design Engineers
---

These are notes from the book titled "Systems Engineering Toolbox."


**Definitions**:
1. A tool is defined as a set of procedures to accomplish a specific function. 
2. A methodology is defined as a collection of tools, rules, and postulates to accomplish a purpose.

*Types of tools*
|Tools    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|Concept development tools | Are useful when selecting the preferred option of several alternatives. Among these alternatives are such things as cost, complexity, weight, safety, manufacturability, or perhaps determining the ratio of expected future benefits to the expected future costs.|

System safety and reliability tools, section 3, address the following areas of concern: (1) identify and assess hazards, (2) identify failure modes and show their consequences or effects, and (3) symbolic logic modeling tools used to understand the failure mechanisms of the system. These tools are also used to determine the probability of failure occurring or the reliability that a component will operate success- fully, either in comparative or absolute terms, as applicable.

Design-related analytical tools, section 4, are applied to show (1) which parameters affect a sys- tem the most or least, (2) a method for specifying dimensions and tolerances, and (3) the determination of the possibility or probability of having form, fit, or function problems with a design, or to determine a tolerance or dimension necessary to avoid these problems.

When there is a desire to monitor performance, identify relationships, or reveal the most important variables in a set of data, graphical data interpretation tools are typically applied.

Statistical tools and methodologies, section 6, compare sample statistics and population statistics. Variations are identified and mathematical relationships are determined.


Total quality management (TQM) tools, section 7, are applied to continuously improve perfor- mance at all levels of operation, in all areas of an organization, using all available human and capital resources. Finally, quantitative tools that are used to identify potentially hazardous conditions based on past empirical data are trend analysis tools, section 8. The ultimate objective for these tools is to assess the current status, and to forecast future events.
